## Project Motivation

Jobly was developed as a bootcamp exercise to practice **Node.js** and **React** knowledge. 

## Project Functionalities

- The project is divided by 4 aspects: users, companies, jobs and auth (authentication).
- There is only one user's type: the user who wants to find a job opportunity and to apply for it. 
- The user can search for companies and see all the jobs that they are offering. Or the user can search directly for a job, based on the job title. 
- Once the user found the desirable job, he/she can apply for it. It is possible to apply for as many jobs as he/she wants. But, it's not possible (yet) to undo the apply action. 
- The authentication process uses a user's *token*. It goes throught the *http request* inside the *header*. To keep the user's logged in, the app uses *local storge*.

## Deploy:
